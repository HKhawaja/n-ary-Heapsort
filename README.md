# n-ary-Heapsort
An implementation of Heapsort with a heap of branch factor n, where n can vary.

The purpose of this project was to analyze how the branch factor of the heap affects the time for Heapsort to sort a certain array; more specifically, how the runtime of the maxHeapify() method was affected by the number of branches of the heap.
